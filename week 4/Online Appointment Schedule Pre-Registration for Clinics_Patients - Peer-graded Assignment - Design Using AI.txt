Theme: Healthcare

Concept: This will help new & existing patients to do online scheduling for their clinic 
visits/physical consultation and/or pre-registration at ease.

Target Audience: Young adults, parents, or senior

AI Integration: AI will integrate using clinic's existing Appointment calendar app (eg. Google Calendar), 
input for Doctor/Physician's name, form for Patient's Information

Ethical Consideration: We need to ensure that all client's data shall be secured and their privacy is protected. 
All Patient's info will be strictly stored for clinic's documentation purposes and administration only. 
Limited access only to the designated Doctor/Physician and registered clinic personnel.

Implementation Plan: AI will inform the client that an automated secretary will be available to assist 
them in the scheduling/pre-registration process. This will show:
 1) Appointment calendar - with available clinic date & times that client/patient could book appointment for
 2) Doctor/Physician's name - the client/patient will select the Doctor/Physician's name; 
    then it will show Doctor's specialization
 3) Patient's Info - the client/patient will input patient's name, date of birth, patient id (if already an existing patient), 
    contact #, purpose of visit, drug allergies (if any)
 4) Before ending the session, we will ask for User's feedback on - a) rate how was their user experience 
    on the entire automated scheduling/pre-registration process, b) other concerns, and c) what areas 
    still needs to be improved in our system).
 5) Thank the client/patient for their time. Let them know that our human secretary will contact them 
    within the day once appointment is coordinated with the Doctor/Physician and able to check availability.
